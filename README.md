# Introduction

Meet CheerBot, your friendly Discord companion designed to spread positivity and inspiration. Whether you need a quick pick-me-up or just a smile, CheerBot delivers uplifting quotes and cheerful vibes at your command.

## Inspiration

CheerBot was inspired by our experiences at BrainStation. We noticed that many of us faced challenges and difficult moments along the way. Recognizing how much a simple, positive message could help, we decided to create a bot that could bring that same sense of encouragement to Discord communities.

# Bot Features

- **Random Quotes:** Use `/cheerup` to get a dose of positivity with an inspiring quote.

- **Simple Commands:** Access helpful features like `/server` for server info, and `/user` for personalized user info.

- **Always Ready:** Lightweight and efficient, CheerBot seamlessly fits into any Discord server, spreading joy with every interaction.

*More features to be added.*
